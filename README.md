# **Amazon USA Sales Analysis Project**
## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 50,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using Sql Server. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.

## **Solving Business Problems**

### Solutions Implemented:
```

select * from order_items;

--create a new column

alter table order_items
add  total_sale Float;

--Update table 
update order_items
set total_sale = quantity * price_per_unit;

select * from order_items
order by quantity desc;

select top 10
oi.product_id,p.product_name,
sum(oi.total_sale) as total_sale,
